Hello, I'm Anuja! 👋
I'm a Computer Engineering student who loves turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications. Whether it’s a mobile app for sports updates, or a billing system with payment integration I’m always looking for ways to blend creativity with code.

About Me
🔭 I’m currently working on SportsBoard – a mobile app for sports match updates, ticketing, and player selection in Nepal.
🌱 I’m learning full-stack development through projects in event management, billing systems, and interactive web/mobile applications.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that solve real-world problems and have a lasting impact.
⚡ Fun fact: I often start with “just a small tweak” in my code and end up building a whole new feature or project.
